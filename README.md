# ISL-python

[*An Introduction to Statistical Learning*](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) is a textbook by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. Conceptual and applied exercises are provided at the end of each chapter covering supervised learning.

This repository contains my solutions to the labs and exercises as Jupyter Notebooks written in Python using:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Patsy
- StatsModels
- Sklearn


Perhaps of most interest will be the recreation of some functions from the R language that I couldn't find in the Python ecosystem. These took me some time to reproduce but the implementation details are not essential to the concepts taught in the book so please feel free to reuse. For example, a reproduction of R's `lm()` four-way diagnostic plot for linear regression in Chapter 3. Also, a collection of [all required datasets]((./Notebooks/data)) is provided in .csv format.
